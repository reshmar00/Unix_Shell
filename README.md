This `Unix Shell` project is a custom shell implementation developed in `C++`, drawing inspiration from well-known environments like `bash` and `zsh`. Utilizing POSIX system calls, the shell can interpret lines of input as individual user commands, proficiently managing operations such as `ls`, `cat someFile`, and `echo hello world`. Beyond this, the shell is equipped with **I/O redirection**, **piping**, and offers a smooth user experience with features like **tab completion**.
